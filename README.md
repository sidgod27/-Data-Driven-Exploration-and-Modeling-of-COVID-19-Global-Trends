# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project performs a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 pandemic data using Python. The primary goal is to explore trends, visualize key metrics, and uncover insightful patterns related to the spread and impact of the virus. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical summaries, and graphical visualizations.

## Motivation
Understanding the COVID-19 pandemic's progression helps in gauging the effectiveness of interventions and in planning for future healthcare needs. This project aims to provide a data-driven perspective on the pandemic using publicly available datasets.

## Data Sources
- John Hopkins University COVID-19 dataset (global case counts and deaths)
- World Health Organization (WHO) reports
- Government released regional data sources
- Other publicly accessible data repositories related to COVID-19
